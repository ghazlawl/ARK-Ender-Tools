# Ender Pearl

```
[b]Mod ID: 804839511[/b]

Allows players to teleport by throwing ender pearls. Once thrown, the user is teleported to wherever the ender pearl lands. Perfect for raiding bases or navigating to those hard-to-reach places.

Ender pearls are a rare drop (10%) from killing any creature. The drop chance can be changed using an INI setting.

Ender pearls can also be crafted using silica pearls and blood packs. The engram can be removed using an INI setting.

[b]Please remember to use ender pearls responsibly. Repeated or inappropriate use may result in death or dismemberment![/b]
