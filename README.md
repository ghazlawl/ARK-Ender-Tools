# Ender Pearl

```
[b]Mod ID: 804839511[/b]

Allows players to teleport by throwing ender pearls. Once thrown, the user is teleported to wherever the ender pearl lands. Perfect for raiding bases or navigating to those hard-to-reach places.

Ender pearls are a rare drop (10%) from killing any creature. The drop chance can be changed using an INI setting.

[b]Please remember to use ender pearls responsibly. Repeated or inappropriate use may result in death or dismemberment![/b]
